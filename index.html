            <h2>Praise for A Dance with the Dragons</h2>
            <p>
                “Filled with vividly rendered set pieces, unexpected turnings, assorted cliffhangers and moments of
                appalling cruelty, A Dance with Dragons is epic fantasy as it should be written: passionate, compelling,
                convincingly detailed and thoroughly imagined.”

            </p>

                “Long live George Martin . . . a literary dervish, enthralled by complicated characters and vivid
                language, and bursting with the wild vision of the very best tale tellers.”
                <strong>-The New York Times</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
