            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                A Dance with Dragons is the fifth book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It picks up where a Feast for Crows ended as the Battle of Five Kinds concludes. The story continues to follow the epic journeys of members of Houses Stark, Baratheon, Lannister, Targaryen, and other minor houses members. Jon Snow is at the wall in the north trying to prepare for battle with a legion of white-walkers (frozen zombie-like creatures) that grow in numbers as their leader resurrects the dead from the living’s army. Jon is aided by Stannis Baratheon and his army and his mysterious companion Melisandre. Stannis is the “True King of Westeros but his nephew Joffrey has taken the throne. The war of Five Kings had been fought as the region was destabilized when Joffrey’s father was killed by his mother Cersei Lannister.  Joffrey is a psychopath and has Jon’s sisters held captive. He is unable to aid them because of his sworn oath to the Nights Watch. The Nights Watch is an ancient brotherhood sworn to defend the realm against the White-Walkers, Giants, and other ghastly horrors from the North. They are no longer given any titles and can no longer do battle on behalf of their houses.  

                The book follows a total of 18 characters and each chapter is named a character’s name and is told through that character’s eyes.  The Dance of Dragons was the last published book in the series. George R.R Martin is currently finishing the Sixth book, Winds of Winter. The HBO series Game of thrones season 7 was the adapted version of A Dance of Dragons. Season 8 went beyond the published pages and told tales that are yet to be confirmed in the printed version of Winds of Winter.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    “Filled with vividly rendered set pieces, unexpected turnings, assorted cliffhangers and moments of
                    appalling cruelty, A Dance with Dragons is epic fantasy as it should be written: passionate, compelling,
                    convincingly detailed and thoroughly imagined.”
