    <h2>Praise for A Dance with the Dragons</h2>
    <p>
        “Filled with vividly rendered set pieces, unexpected turnings, assorted cliffhangers and moments of appalling cruelty, A Dance with Dragons is epic fantasy as it should be written: passionate, compelling, convincingly detailed and thoroughly imagined.”
        <strong>- The Washington Post</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Long live George Martin . . . a literary dervish, enthralled by complicated characters and vivid language, and bursting with the wild vision of the very best tale tellers.”
        <strong>-The New York Times</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        “One of the best series in the history of fantasy.”
        <strong>- Los Angeles Times</strong>
